# User Registration Form

This is a registration form that was developed with Spring MVC

## Instructions on Running the Application

To run this application, you will need to have an IDE installed on your computer. I have used **Eclipse** to develop this form. You will also need to use a web browser, **any browser** will work. 

## Input Requirements

For this application to be submitted, you must enter a name *(that has more than two letters)*, and email address *(that has a minimum length of 10)*, a password *(with a minimum length of 8)*, and a birthday *(that is between two dates 01-01-1920 and 12-31-2020).* There are a few more inputs but they are not required to submit the form.

## About the Application

First, you will be directed to the **home page** and you must click on a button that directs you to the **registration form page**. On the registration form page, it gathers information that is entered by the user. Before submitting the form, it makes sure that all input are in the correct format. Once submitted, the form takes you to **registration success page**, and will display all information that the user has entered from the previous page.
